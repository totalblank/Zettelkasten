# What should I do?

For as long as I can remember, I have been the mediocre one. I somehow got into BUET but then I became stagnant. I am very poor at managing my resources and taking care of things that I care about. I don't have the common sense to handle things correctly. I cannot prioritize tasks, so sometimes I overwork and sometimes I don't do shit. I sleep a lot.

The bottom line is, I am nothing where I want to be. I have some major mental issues that I don't want to talk about right now. I think everyone has some issue or other, so my situation is not so uncommon.

	But we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever

Most of my peers are clearly ahead of me whom I thought inferior. That doesn't make me inferior to them but it sure does break my confidence. Am I going to change? What do I mean by change? I don't need to clearly define everything but I must define some important things. A month from now, I want to be better. 

1. Complete the thesis (about 20 hours within 14th march).
2. Be regular at gym (4 hours per week).
3. Minimize external chaos by --
	1. Minimize expenditure.
	2. Never be angry.
	3. Do all the responsibilities necessary.
	4. Organize.
4. Start learning trading (2 hours a day from 16th march).
5. Start building apps with Next.js (2 hours per day).
6. API construction with django (1 hour per day).
7. Start learning math (3 hours per week).
8. Start working on papers (1 hour per day).

So theoretically, after 14th of this month, I need about 7 hours a day which is going to be tough if I don't focus. Pay heed to seemingly insignificant tasks, matter, and thoughts. I must do all these, at any cost.

# Snap out of it

Stop looking for pleasure, there is no pleasure. Pleasure is a scam. Pleasure exists nowhere. All there is, is pain. I don't even know what pleasure is. Sure, I get pleasure from buying new tech gears, but that is because I think to myself that I can do more with the tech gear that I purchased, not because I wanted that. One of my friends said once, understanding is ecstasy. But looking smart is not a continuous process. You can't look smart all the time. You have to spend long boring hours at the desk to master something. More often than not, most people are not going to value your capabilities. But that is not why you should learn. Also, smartness is sexy. Being fit and smart is golden. Nothing is ever easy. But if I always pursue pain, I am never going to be disappointed.

Within the next 3 months,

* Start making money through coding.
* Get an in depth understanding of trading.
* Do other things

Things are serious now.

# Current Situation

One might think that I am in a bad situation right now, I sometimes do. But that is not right. Within 3 months from now on, I can generate more than 100000 taka. I can generate more than that if I try, and I am going to try. In the meantime, I am going to thoroughly learn React.js, Next.js, and Python and build my portfolio.

# Halt

Her entire existence screams to be that I am not good enough. Everyone around me are screaming to me that I am not good enough. But I am. I swear to God Almighty, that I am. I will prove to me and to the world that I am not a loser. I will be good enough, to me, as well as to all those people. I may sound like a child, but it is what it is. Fuck all of you.

# Wasted

Sometimes, I don't feel like doing things. But 'feeling' is not the correct way of doing things. The best of doing things is, well, doing things. For the most part of the day, planning and executing is the best option. 

* Estimate the number of free hours in a day.
* Plan accordingly.
* Stick to the plan.

No day should be an exception. Just plan the day, everything else is going to fall into place.

# Lock In

My current situation is not so good. There are some issues,

* I graduated and now I am out of my dorm room.
* I didn't save any money for future, so I don't have a lot money on me right now.
* I don't have any hard skill on me that I can sell to earn money.
* I don't have the physique that I want to have.
* I do not have any consistent income.

Each and every one of these must change. I cannot change the fact that I am out of my dorm room and I am not going to be in touch with my friends all the time. I really liked my dorm room, but every good thing must come to an end and there is nothing that could be done. 

I didn't save any money. But am currently doing 4 tuitions, and they are paying me a decent sum. I can get by fine with my tuition income. But there is a catch, I must move abroad for higher education. I cannot do tuition when I am abroad. I am learning to develop websites (frontend, backend, and database) with Next.js, React.js, Django, and SQL. I am not good at it yet, but if I manage to give it another 100 hours, I think I can be decently good at it. Currently, I am working on my portfolio app, making notes and flashcards specifically. After that, I am going to build some really good projects (frontend, API, and data science) and showcase the projects in my website. When my portfolio looks decent enough, I will open accounts in major freelancing platforms and share my work with my friends. Then, I can hope to get started with my coding career. I hope to get all these done within 3 months.

The hard skills that I wish to acquire are DS and ML (using Python), Next.js and React.js. Eventually, I want to be a full time programmer and data scientist and that is not going to be easy. I have to put in a lot of focused hours into these areas.

Getting in good shape is straight-forward, I just need to follow a diet consistently and hit the gym regularly. That is all. But these are not so straight-forward to implement. Nothing of anything I plan to implement is straight-forward to implement. Sometimes, I am just tired. I must make sure that I am sleeping adequately.

For the upcoming 3 months, income is sorted out.

# Be Smart

All the things that are going on in here, inside of my head, must stop. I have sorted out everything yet sometimes I am lost. This can't happen frequently. I don't have infinite amount of time.

Sometimes, I am sad that my BUET merit was far behind. I can't change the past. What is done, is done. There is no way to revert what is done. I have time. I cannot look back, I have no right to look back because I have too much work to do. But sometimes, I am really sad, honestly. I don't like being dumb, I never liked being dumb. Yet I couldn't get a high rank. I must remember that I can't change the past. But I will change the future.

When I am comfortable, I forget all my worries and short-comings. I drown myself into shit. I don't plan, nor do I execute. But this can't happen forever. These shit stops now. Plan and execute.

Sometimes, I lose my control and try to do all things at once. But that is the wrong way of doing things. Step by step. Be calm. Harmony and focus.

# Return of the Phoenix

Today was not bad. But I still wasted some amount of time. I have got a lot of work to do.

# Stuck

This is what you get for getting comfortable. You get nothing. Just admit that you are never going to be happy. Happiness is not for you. Just work and work. Don't think about anything else.

# Roam and Roar

I mustn't worry about unnecessary things. Women don't matter simply because I am not a woman. I must always be focused. That might sound like an abnormal task, but I'm neither trying to be normal nor sane. I don't mind the insanity as long as I am the best of the best. I am created some TODO items, I am going to achieve all of them.

But first, I need to be firm on the way things are going to be. I plan on generating income through coding. For that, I have to build some projects. What projects can I think of? I am interested in Pure Mathematics and Machine Learning. I want to use these to build some projects.

# Reality

Even wonder why most rich guys are not fit? Yes, because they've cracked the code. They know that in this life, what matters is money and social acceptance. And society doesn't condemn unfit men, society condemns poor guys. Majority of the societal members admire rich guys and not fit guys. This is why there are more rich guys than there are fit guys. 

All these are common knowledge, but these hit you sometimes very hard. I'll be needing money, soon. And I must create a plan.

All things are necessary, some are more necessary and some are less. These things are calculated by fools. Everything is game. Treat everything as game.
