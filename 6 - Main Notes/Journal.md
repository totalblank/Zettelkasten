# What should I do?

For as long as I can remember, I have been the mediocre one. I somehow got into BUET but then I became stagnant. I am very poor at managing my resources and taking care of things that I care about. I don't have the common sense to handle things correctly. I cannot prioritize tasks, so sometimes I overwork and sometimes I don't do shit. I sleep a lot.

The bottom line is, I am nothing where I want to be. I have some major mental issues that I don't want to talk about right now. I think everyone has some issue or other, so my situation is not so uncommon.

	But we cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever

Most of my peers are clearly ahead of me whom I thought inferior. That doesn't make me inferior to them but it sure does break my confidence. Am I going to change? What do I mean by change? I don't need to clearly define everything but I must define some important things. A month from now, I want to be better. 

1. Complete the thesis (about 20 hours within 14th march).
2. Be regular at gym (4 hours per week).
3. Minimize external chaos by --
	1. Minimize expenditure.
	2. Never be angry.
	3. Do all the responsibilities necessary.
	4. Organize.
4. Start learning trading (2 hours a day from 16th march).
5. Start building apps with Next.js (2 hours per day).
6. API construction with django (1 hour per day).
7. Start learning math (3 hours per week).
8. Start working on papers (1 hour per day).

So theoretically, after 14th of this month, I need about 7 hours a day which is going to be tough if I don't focus. Pay heed to seemingly insignificant tasks, matter, and thoughts. I must do all these, at any cost.

# Snap out of it

Stop looking for pleasure, there is no pleasure. Pleasure is a scam. Pleasure exists nowhere. All there is, is pain. I don't even know what pleasure is. Sure, I get pleasure from buying new tech gears, but that is because I think to myself that I can do more with the tech gear that I purchased, not because I wanted that. One of my friends said once, understanding is ecstasy. But looking smart is not a continuous process. You can't look smart all the time. You have to spend long boring hours at the desk to master something. More often than not, most people are not going to value your capabilities. But that is not why you should learn. Also, smartness is sexy. Being fit and smart is golden. Nothing is ever easy. But if I always pursue pain, I am never going to be disappointed.

Within the next 3 months,

* Start making money through coding.
* Get an in depth understanding of trading.
* Do other things

Things are serious now.

# Current Situation

One might think that I am in a bad situation right now, I sometimes do. But that is not right. Within 3 months from now on, I can generate more than 100000 taka. I can generate more than that if I try, and I am going to try. In the meantime, I am going to thoroughly learn React.js, Next.js, and Python and build my portfolio.

# Halt

Her entire existence screams to be that I am not good enough. Everyone around me are screaming to me that I am not good enough. But I am. I swear to God Almighty, that I am. I will prove to me and to the world that I am not a loser. I will be good enough, to me, as well as to all those people. I may sound like a child, but it is what it is. Fuck all of you.

# Wasted

Sometimes, I don't feel like doing things. But 'feeling' is not the correct way of doing things. The best of doing things is, well, doing things. For the most part of the day, planning and executing is the best option. 

* Estimate the number of free hours in a day.
* Plan accordingly.
* Stick to the plan.

No day should be an exception. Just plan the day, everything else is going to fall into place.

# Lock In

My current situation is not so good. There are some issues,

* I graduated and now I am out of my dorm room.
* I didn't save any money for future, so I don't have a lot money on me right now.
* I don't have any hard skill on me that I can sell to earn money.
* I don't have the physique that I want to have.
* I do not have any consistent income.

Each and every one of these must change. I cannot change the fact that I am out of my dorm room and I am not going to be in touch with my friends all the time. I really liked my dorm room, but every good thing must come to an end and there is nothing that could be done. 

I didn't save any money. But am currently doing 4 tuitions, and they are paying me a decent sum. I can get by fine with my tuition income. But there is a catch, I must move abroad for higher education. I cannot do tuition when I am abroad. I am learning to develop websites (frontend, backend, and database) with Next.js, React.js, Django, and SQL. I am not good at it yet, but if I manage to give it another 100 hours, I think I can be decently good at it. Currently, I am working on my portfolio app, making notes and flashcards specifically. After that, I am going to build some really good projects (frontend, API, and data science) and showcase the projects in my website. When my portfolio looks decent enough, I will open accounts in major freelancing platforms and share my work with my friends. Then, I can hope to get started with my coding career. I hope to get all these done within 3 months.

The hard skills that I wish to acquire are DS and ML (using Python), Next.js and React.js. Eventually, I want to be a full time programmer and data scientist and that is not going to be easy. I have to put in a lot of focused hours into these areas.

Getting in good shape is straight-forward, I just need to follow a diet consistently and hit the gym regularly. That is all. But these are not so straight-forward to implement. Nothing of anything I plan to implement is straight-forward to implement. Sometimes, I am just tired. I must make sure that I am sleeping adequately.

For the upcoming 3 months, income is sorted out.

# Be Smart

All the things that are going on in here, inside of my head, must stop. I have sorted out everything yet sometimes I am lost. This can't happen frequently. I don't have infinite amount of time.

Sometimes, I am sad that my BUET merit was far behind. I can't change the past. What is done, is done. There is no way to revert what is done. I have time. I cannot look back, I have no right to look back because I have too much work to do. But sometimes, I am really sad, honestly. I don't like being dumb, I never liked being dumb. Yet I couldn't get a high rank. I must remember that I can't change the past. But I will change the future.

When I am comfortable, I forget all my worries and short-comings. I drown myself into shit. I don't plan, nor do I execute. But this can't happen forever. These shit stops now. Plan and execute.

Sometimes, I lose my control and try to do all things at once. But that is the wrong way of doing things. Step by step. Be calm. Harmony and focus.

# Return of the Phoenix

Today was not bad. But I still wasted some amount of time. I have got a lot of work to do.

# Stuck

This is what you get for getting comfortable. You get nothing. Just admit that you are never going to be happy. Happiness is not for you. Just work and work. Don't think about anything else.

# Roam and Roar

I mustn't worry about unnecessary things. Women don't matter simply because I am not a woman. I must always be focused. That might sound like an abnormal task, but I'm neither trying to be normal nor sane. I don't mind the insanity as long as I am the best of the best. I am created some TODO items, I am going to achieve all of them.

But first, I need to be firm on the way things are going to be. I plan on generating income through coding. For that, I have to build some projects. What projects can I think of? I am interested in Pure Mathematics and Machine Learning. I want to use these to build some projects.

# Reality

Even wonder why most rich guys are not fit? Yes, because they've cracked the code. They know that in this life, what matters is money and social acceptance. And society doesn't condemn unfit men, society condemns poor guys. Majority of the societal members admire rich guys and not fit guys. This is why there are more rich guys than there are fit guys. 

All these are common knowledge, but these hit you sometimes very hard. I'll be needing money, soon. And I must create a plan.

All things are necessary, some are more necessary and some are less. These things are calculated by fools. Everything is game. Treat everything as game.

# Thorough

Being thorough about everything is necessary. I can't afford to be half in. I must go all out. There are some real life tasks I must attend to,

1. My father is getting old. I have to earn a lot of money and give to him. He loves spending money.
2. I'll be needing two laptops and two tabs (for me and my brother).
3. I need savings.

I have decided that my primary earning source will be developing software. I have to build a lot of things, a lot of projects and start doing freelancing work.

# In a Fix

Well, I know that I have to work and do this and do that. But I really can't pull things through. I went through quite a bit of transformation for the last couple of months. I quit smoking, I had to leave my life at BUET, I started making my coding portfolio. I have started worrying about things a lot more than I used to. But worrying never solved anything, ever. In the end, I am just not sharp enough and I can't perform up to my mark. This is not good. I must ease into things. That doesn't mean I should delay things, no. Rather, I have to give it some time. Let's say I become ultra focused, and then after an hour, I am out of my chair. This is not good. Rather, if I start slowly and build up to the task, it will ensure a higher chance of success. 

Also, I must keep room for entertainment and limit my daily social media usage. Social media is not entertainment. I love reading books and I must get back to it. Be healthy and sharp.

In my opinion, currently, I am the dumbest I have ever been. I always put things off for tomorrow. But tomorrow doesn't exist. Now is the only time. I must make a plan and stick to it. The plan must me made with pen and paper. I have to do this, I have to do that. I have to fix myself on something. I have everything that I could possibly need. All I have to do is point out what are the things that are important in this lifetime, and I am going to be all set. I have an image of myself that I subconsciously formed over the years. **I want to be a fit good looking person who is good at math, good at coding, has a lot of money, who is also good at playing the flute, who also strums guitar from time to time.**
It aches me a lot that I have wasted a lot of time on shit that doesn't matter. Instead, I should have focused on things that do matter. I have a lot of time. If I concentrate and keep calm, I can be all the things that I want to be. My time starts now.

# Shit life

Sometimes, I honestly think that my life is an eternal series of farces. After a while, I think to myself nothing and decide that I have time, and that I am going to be all okay. I don't know why I think that to myself, but I do think that to myself. Now, I don't know what is going on with myself. I don't know what I am lacking, am I lacking discipline, or luck? I can't tell.

I like coding and I have been exposed to coding when I was just 17. Yet, I couldn't do anything significant with coding. I always wanted to have a good body, but I don't. And I've been exercising for about 6 years now, well, on and off. These are not the point. To my understanding, my choices are very poor. I can't make good choices. That is why I am always lagging behind. Due to my poor choices, I am not who I wanted to be. I am going to say to myself that I am going to change and everything changes now. But am I really going to change?

For example, tomorrow, I have a lot of time. I have one tuition at 7 PM, and gym at 8:30 to 9:45. After that, I should be all set by 10:30 PM. From 10:30, I am going to have about 4 hours, from which, I should be able to utilize 3 hours. I am going to wake up at 10 AM and I should be all set by 11 AM. These are all pessimistic thoughts, and I know that in reality, I have way more time than am writing now. From 11 AM to 7 PM, I have 8 hours, I should be able to utilize about 7 hours here. So, I should be able to utilize 10 hours tomorrow. But am I really going to? I must. There are no other options.

Mind doesn't function the same all the time. What value can I provide to my customers? What are the things that I am capable of doing?

* I am a full stack developer with sufficient expertise in both frontend and backend.
* I build the frontend using React.js and/or Next.js and the backend using Django Rest Framework.
* I can perform exploratory and inferential data analysis on any type of data.
* I can build ML models using TensorFlow and Keras, train the model, and test it. I can argue about the various parameters of the model.
* I can do your DSA homework.

# What could've been

I really wanted to be a competitive coder. I am 24 years old now. Even if I try, I can't be one. In the following 6 months, I am going to track everything that I important to me.

* I am going to start earning money through Fiverr using React, Next, Python, and ML. Basically, everything I can, I am going to offer.
* I am going to get a phenomenal score in GRE.
* I am going to be fit.
* I am going to finish my paper.
* Each day, I am going to spend 1 hour learning and doing trading.

I will track every single thing, and how many time I am spending on each. I am hoping to give 100 hours per task.

# Dependency

I have become too much dependent on things that don't matter. I no longer am dependent on unnecessary things.
It takes a lot of energy to do things. That is why, mind chooses the easy way out.

# Turmoil

I was quite a bit harsh today. Being rude affects me more than it affects others. But today was necessary. She doesn't seem to understand what I say. But I think I made myself pretty clear today. Even my aunt was there. I conveyed everything honestly and brutally, which I am not proud of. But I had to, because she can't understand when I am polite.
I have figured out that the only things that are of most importance in this lifetime is myself, and my family, and nothing else. I think I am always going to have myself, and I also think that I am going to have my family. But it doesn't matter if they are not by my side, but I am always going to be at their side. I think that I am enough for myself. I don't think that I need any emotional or mental assurance from anyone except for myself. I don't need her to love me.
At this point, I don't love anybody except for my family. But I feel bad for all the bad things I said to her. I treated her really badly yesterday. But the thing is, she also treated me badly before. I should not feel bad about this, but I do. I think have to live with this trait of mine. Because people are not going to listen to your kind words. Kindness is not always the answer. Sometimes, you must behave roughly. I think I should sleep.

# Dai Ippo

So, today, I am going to go to sleep at 1:45 AM and sleep within 2 AM. I am going to be occupied from 2 PM to 9:30 PM (sharp). From 9:30 to 1:30, I am going to have about 4 hours. Must utilize 3 hours. And I have 1 hour now. 4 hours is not bad for someone who didn't study even for 1 hour per day in the last couple of days.

# Sadness and Sorrow

So, do you think being sad and stuck means shit to anybody? It actually doesn't. She will never feel the way you feel about her. It's best of just move on. Can you love anybody like you loved her? Probably not. But this information does not change anything. There is no way of her to know how intensely you feel for her. Even if she did, you don't know what she would do. Accept the fact that there is nothing to do. Some things are not meant to be. There is the option to bend space and time. There are tricks and workarounds, they work really good if one is clever enough. But, when you are clever, you don't need anybody to give you anything. I want her to give herself to me, everything about her. I want everything of her, every part of her. I want to melt into her and I want her to melt into me. But that is not going to ever happen unless you are clever. In reality, there is no way.

# Get going, there's no time

Make the plan and stick to it unless something unavoidable happens. Never lose sight of the focus. There is no time. I am not get going.

# The only choice

The only option left is to make a routine and stick to it. I have been saying this for a while now, but I haven't been doing anything about it. 

I never make generic comments. I know myself and everything about myself. I don't need to know anything else. I don't need to know what others think. I only need to focus on myself. Let's remember what Sun Wukong said,

	Come at me, all of you
