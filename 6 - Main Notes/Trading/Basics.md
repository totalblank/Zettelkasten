Let's say there is a new coffee company. To get into market, they will be needing IPO (Initial Public Offering). So, the company advertises to big investors. If the investors are convinced, they invest and the company gets its IPO. After this, the company is launched in the official market and any individual or company can buy its stock.

Buying stocks makes the investors partial owners in the business. Their investment helps the company to grow. As the company becomes more successful, more buyers may see potential and start buying stocks. As demand for the stock increases, so does their price, increasing the cost for perspective buyers and raising the value of the company's stocks people already own.

If for some reason, the company seems to become less profitable, the investors (people who bought previous stocks) can think that their stock values are going to decline, and they sell their stocks with the hopes of making a profit before the stock price falls too low. So, sellers are selling because they think the company is gong to be less valuable (Strong Selling Pressure).

Demand declines $\rightarrow$ Stock price falls $\rightarrow$ Market value falls.

* **Buyers:** Want to buy the stock because they think the stock price is going to go up in the future.
* **Sellers:** Want to sell the stock because they think the stock price is going to go down in the future.
* **Supply:** Amount of shares people want to sell.
* **Demand:** Amount of shares people want to purchase.

If there is a greater number of buyers than sellers (more demand), the buyers bid the prices of the stocks up to entice sellers to get rid of them.

Conversely, a large number of sellers (more supply) bids down the stocks, hoping to entice buyers to purchase.
