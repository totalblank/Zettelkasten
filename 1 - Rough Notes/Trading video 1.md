Poverty makes you dumb. You must be interested in trading which is obvious because if you are not interested, you not going to stick to it. And if you don't stick to it, it is not going to generate enough revenue for you.

Let's say, I want to generate an additional 500 dollars to my income. If I get  2% return per month consistently, I would need to invest 500/0.02 = 25000 dollars. If I was getting 4%, I would need 12500 dollars, so on and so forth. Best traders get from 2 to 6%, it varies. So, being average is not an option.

Usually it takes from 12 to 18 months to be profitable in trading. So, don't be usual. First 6 months is spent on learning. Second 6 months is spent on trading via a demo account.

Trading is a skill, not a hack. I can't afford to be inconsistent and slack off but I must also realize that it is not going to be an overnight transformation. I need to be consistent and focused. Remember what Master Oogway said, "Harmony and focus".

Trading is lonely.

## Reading Prices

### Candle Stick

There are four components of a **Candle Stick**,

1. The Open Price
2. The Close Price
3. The High of the Session
4. The Low of the Session

![[Trading - bullish and bearing candle.png| 500]]

The left one is a Red Candle (a Bearing Candle) and the right one isa Green Candle (a Bullish Candle).

### OHLC Bars

* O - Opening Price
* H - Highest of the Session
* L - Lowest of the Session
* C - Closing Price

### Candle Stick Anatomy


![[Trading - long wicks.png| 500]]

In the above diagram, the green candle stick indicates that the market is in a strong buying pressure scenario. Meaning, after the opening, the seller have tried to push all the way down, but got rejected, and the session closed at the top making it a bullish candle. After this session, we are likely to see a continuation of an upward moving market. 

In the above diagram, the **red candle stick** indicates that the market is in **a strong selling pressure scenario**. Meaning, after the opening, the buyers have tried to push this market right up (to the High of the Session), and the rejected and slapped right back down to the lowest price and then the session was closed. After this session, we are likely to see a continuation of a downward moving market.

![[Trading - long upper and lower wick.png| 500]]

Even though the left candle theoretically is a bullish candle, it is not. Because, sellers tried to push the price high, but got rejected and price closed slightly higher than the opening price. So the demand is going to be saturated soon and the price is going to fall. **Deceleration is eminent.**

Even though the right candle theoretically is a bearish candle, it is not. Because, buyers tried to push the price down, but got rejected and was forced to buy at a higher price than they wanted to. So the demand is going to to increase soon and the price is going to go up. **Acceleration is eminent.**

#### Doji Candles

![[Trading - doji candles.png| 500]]

* **Classic Doji:** state of market indecision where buyers and sellers are evenly matched. 
* **Long-Legged Doji:** identified by its long upper and lower shadows (wicks), indicating high volatility and uncertainty in the market. This pattern reflects a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers, with neither side having a clear advantage. The long-legged doji suggest that a trend may be losing its strength and that a reversal could be imminent. Closely monitor the market for potential changes in direction.
* Gravestone Doji: indicates a potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish. The long upper shadow suggest that buyers pushed the price up during the trading session, but ultimately sellers regained control, pushing the price back down.
* Dragonfly Doji: indicates a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. The long shadow implies that sellers drove the price down initially, but buyers regained control, pushing the price back up. Traders often interpret the dragonfly doji as a bullish signal, suggesting a possible upward reversal. 
* Four Price Doji: represents a state of complete market indecision and suggest that neither buyers not sellers had control over the price during the trading session. This pattern indicates a temporary equilibrium in the market and may signal a potential trend reversal.

The above candles don't have any wick. Left one is a Strong Buying Candle - the market is in strong momentum to the upside, and the right one is a Strong Selling Candle - the market is in strong momentum to the downside.

## Trading Strategy

Six main components of a Trading Strategy to get trading edge are,

1. Identifying **market condition**.
2. Identifying **market phase**.
3. Identify the **Support and Resistance**.
4. Identify when to place orders depending on how price behaves.
5. Analyze indicators (Fibonacci retracement, exponential).

### Opportunity Confluence

Identify the Overall Market Condition,

* Overall Upward Market (Bullish)
* Overall Downward Market (Bearing)
* Ranging Market (Not bullish or bearing, moving sideways)
* Indecisive Market - Stay Away


![[Trading - bullish.png| 500]]

The above diagram is of a **Bullish Market**.

![[Treading - bearish.png| 500]]

The above diagram is of a **Bearish Market.**

![[Trading - ranging.png| 500]]

The above diagram is of a **Ranging Market.**

![[Trading - undecisive.png| 500]]

The above diagram is of an **Indecisive Market.**

### Market Phase

* **Run:** along the overall market condition
* **Pullback:** against the overall market condition

![[Trading - bullish phases.png| 500]]
				Phases of a Bullish Market

![[Trading - bearish phases.png| 500]]
				Phases of a Bearish Market

Phases of the market is important because,

* In a Bullish Market, we don't want to buy in the middle of the run, rather, identify the pullback and then look to buy the market. 
* In a Bearish Market, we don't wan to buy in the middle of a pullback, rather, buy in a run, and then sell in the pullback

You're never going to catch the bottoms every time and sell at the top. So try to get in the best price as possible, and then sell at the best price possible.

### Support and Resistance

Technical analysts use support and resistance levels to identify price points on a chart where the probabilities favor a pause or reversal of a prevailing trend.

Support occurs at the point where a downtrend is expected to pause due to a concentration of demand.

Resistance occurs at the point where an uptrend is expected to pause due to a concentration of supply.

* **Support:** In a downtrend, prices fall because there is an excess of supply over demand. The lower prices go, the attractive they become to those waiting on the sidelines to buy the shares. At some level, demand that would have been slowly increasing will rise to the level where it matches supply. At this point, prices will stop falling. **This is support.** Support can be a single price level on the chart or a price zone. In any event, support is an area on a price chart that shows buyers' willingness to buy. It is at this level that demand will usually overwhelm supply, causing the price decline to halt and reverse.
* **Resistance:** Resistance is the opposite of support. Prices move up because there is more demand that supply. As the prices move higher, there will come a point when selling will overwhelm buying. This happens for a variety of reasons,
	* Traders have determined that the prices are too high

Support and resistance areas can be identified on charts using trendlines and moving averages.

When the market is moving harmonically in a trend, the previous resistance normally becomes a decent support level.

![[Trading - support and resistance.png| 500]]

There are two kinds of support and resistance,
* Horizontal
* Angular

Above examples are of horizontal support and resistance. Below is an angular support,

![[Trading - angular support.png| 500]]

When the market is really in trend, angular support or angular resistance is respected by the market. But it isn't ought to.

### Place Orders depending on how the price behaves

Deceleration or running out of steam, when the market is likely to change direction. 

Look at moving averages (exponential, fibonacci)

## Placing Orders

Each of the following are instructions to your broker. When you place an order on the chart, it's an instruction to the broker.

* **Buy Limit:** If the stock price hits Buy Limit, buy some defined amount of the stock. Buy Limit is usually less than the current value of stock because a large amount of stocks can be bought if the price is lower.
* **Sell Limit:** If the stock price hits Sell Limit, sell some defined amount of the stock. Sell Limit is usually greater than the current value of stock because a profit can be made if the sell limit is greater.
* **Buy Stop:** If the stock prices increases and hits Buy Stop, buy some defined amount of stocks. You are anticipating that the stock is going to go up in the future so hoping to maximize profit.
* **Sell Stop:** If the stock prices decreases and hits Sell Stop, sell some defined amount of stocks. You are anticipating that the stock is going to go down in the future so hoping to minimize loss.
* **At Market:** You watching the charts live, and giving instant instructions to your broker as soon as possible.

Three different ways of using these are,

1. **Stop Loss**: If market goes against what we anticipated, and we want to get out of there. 
2. **Entry Order:** 
3. **Profit Target:**
